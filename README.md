# House-Price-Prediction

After downloading the data, Data preprocessing was done including:
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Missing values and Outlier detection
* Scaling of data

Four different types of algorithms were applied including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Error metrics for all the algorithms were same but Gradient Boosting algorithm slightly performed better.
